This is a Python package for evaluating the NRSur7dq2 surrogate model
of gravitational waves from numerical relativity simulations of binary
black hole mergers. A paper describing the model can be found at
https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.96.024058
or
https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07089

Note: This package does not yet support Python 3.

########## Installation instructions:

This package can be installed with
    python setup.py install
or
    python setup.py install --user
to install into a user directory.

########## Usage:
In python, simply
>>> import NRSur7dq2

then load the surrogate data, found at
https://www.black-holes.org/surrogates/
with
>>> sur = NRSur7dq2.NRSurrogate7dq2("NRSur7dq2.h5")

See the NRSur7dq2.NRSurrogate7dq2 docstring for evaluation instructions.
A tutorial notebook can also be found at the above url.
